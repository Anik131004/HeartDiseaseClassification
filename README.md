# HeartDiseaseClassification
This project is a binary classification model that predicts whether a person has heart disease (1) or not (0) based on medical data. Using machine learning algorithms, we analyze key health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate to make accurate predictions.
